Coupon Management API
Overview
The Coupon Management API is a Spring Boot-based backend system designed for an e-commerce platform. It enables the management and application of discount coupons to shopping carts. The API supports:

Cart-wise Coupons: Discounts based on the total cart value.
Product-wise Coupons: Discounts applied to specific products.
BxGy Coupons: "Buy X, Get Y" deals for specific product groups.
Implemented Cases
1. Cart-wise Coupons
Example: 10% off on carts over â‚¹100.
Logic:
If the cart's total value exceeds a specified threshold, the discount is applied as a percentage of the total value.

Payload Example:
json
{
  "type": "CART_WISE",
  "details": { "threshold": 100, "discount": 10 },
  "active": true
}
2. Product-wise Coupons
Example: 20% off on Product A.
Logic:
Discounts are applied to specific products in the cart.

Payload Example:
json

{
  "type": "PRODUCT_WISE",
  "details": { "product_id": 1, "discount": 20 },
  "active": true
}
3. BxGy Coupons
Example: Buy 2 items from Product X, Y, Z and get 1 item from Product A, B, C for free.
Logic:
Verifies if the cart contains sufficient quantities of the "buy" products to determine how many "get" products can be offered for free.

Payload Example:
json

{
  "type": "BxGy",
  "details": {
    "buy_products": [
      { "product_id": 1, "quantity": 2 },
      { "product_id": 2, "quantity": 3 }
    ],
    "get_products": [
      { "product_id": 3, "quantity": 1 }
    ],
    "repetition_limit": 2
  },
  "active": true
}
Unimplemented Cases
Coupon Stacking

Description: Combining multiple coupons for a single cart.
Reason: Requires prioritization logic for overlapping discounts.
Dynamic Coupon Expiry

Description: Support for expiry dates and times.
Reason: Time constraints during development.
Multi-Currency Support

Description: Coupons for carts with multiple currencies.
Reason: Requires integration with currency conversion services.
Limitations
Static Cart Structure:
The current implementation assumes a fixed structure for the cart (Cart and CartItem entities).

No Validation for Coupon Expiry:
Coupons remain applicable regardless of their validity period.

Limited Scalability for Complex Rules:
The system does not support advanced coupon rules such as category-based discounts or region-based restrictions.

No Multi-Coupon Support:
Only one coupon can be applied per cart at a time.

Assumptions
Cart Items:

Each item in the cart has a productId, price, and quantity.
All items belong to the same currency and region.
Coupon Details:

The details field in the coupon is a valid JSON object.
All thresholds, discounts, and product IDs are properly defined in the JSON.
BxGy Coupons:

The "buy" and "get" products are uniquely identified by their productId.
Repetition limits are strictly adhered to.
